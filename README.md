### Description
A module for FoundryVTT which adds support for youtube tracks in audio playlists
(Describe the module here. This should include the module’s function, installation instructions, and anything important to note. Due to the particular oddities of some archiving programs (WinRar, 7zip), and GitHub zip folders, including a screenshot of what the module should look like file-wise in the “public/modules/examplemodule” is appreciated, though not required.)
